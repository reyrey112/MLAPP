Gitignore for a Django project
If you are using Git for version control, you need a Gitignore file to ignore all files that don’t matter and shouldn’t be in your git repository. Think of your virtual environment and all the .pyc files. Those are both generated and can be generated by anyone that has access to your code. Therefore, it’s unnecessary to add those to your repository.

There are a lot of different file types and specific folders that you don’t need. Even outside of Django. Think about your personal settings in VS Code (if you use that). Here is a list which covers all things that you can ignore through gitignore for every Django project you start. Put this list in the root of your Django project and call it .gitignore (yes, with the dot!).

Here's the ultimate Django gitignore#

What we are ignoring and not with this Django .gitignore#
Migrations#
A common question is: "why aren't we ignoring migrations?". Wouldn't it make sense to create the migrations on the server and then migrate them right away? Yes, in some cases that would make sense, but there is a big issue with that. You will always want to have the same migrations on your development machine as on the server. Imagine this: you want a field to be False for every record. You create a new field with default=False, in this case all fields are fields. Then you decide to change the field and change the default to True. The current fields are still marked as False since you ran that migration first. If you wouldn't commit the migration files, all fields would be True since the production server wouldn't know that it was False previously.

Next to that, Django recommends including migration files as they are part of the code base:

The migration files for each app live in a “migrations” directory inside of that app, and are designed to be committed to, and distributed as part of, its codebase. You should be making them once on your development machine and then running the same migrations on your colleagues’ machines, your staging machines, and eventually your production machines.

.pyc files#
Python will always compile your code to byte code. This is saved in the .pyc files. You can't do much with that and we don't need it, python will create them anyway. It's best to just ignore them through .gitignore.

# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
# Pipfile.lock

# UV
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include uv.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
# uv.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
#   https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control
# poetry.lock
# poetry.toml

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#   pdm recommends including project-wide configuration in pdm.toml, but excluding .pdm-python.
#   https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/usage/project/#working-with-version-control
# pdm.lock
# pdm.toml
.pdm-python
.pdm-build/

# pixi
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pixi.lock in version control.
# pixi.lock
#   Pixi creates a virtual environment in the .pixi directory, just like venv module creates one
#   in the .venv directory. It is recommended not to include this directory in version control.
